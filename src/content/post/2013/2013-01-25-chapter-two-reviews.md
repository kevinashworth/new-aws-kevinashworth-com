They like us. They really like us!

_Kevin Ashworth and Leslie Stevens transmute these thankless, cliché-ridden roles into gold through their characters’ no-nonsense acceptance of their faults. Like Kinsolving, Ashworth handles a compelling monologue by balancing emotionalism with cold objectivity._ -- [Backstage](http://www.backstage.com/review/la-theater/-chapter-two-neil-simon-laguna-playhouse/)

_GO. As her best friend and his younger brother, Leslie Stevens and Kevin Ashworth skillfully provide the broad characters Simon’s audiences had expected up to this point._ -- [LA Weekly](http://blogs.laweekly.com/arts/2013/01/dostoevskys_notes_from_underground.php)

_As comic relief, Ashworth manages to carry off both loving, supportive brother and serial philanderer._ -- [StageSceneLA](http://www.stagescenela.com/2013/01/chapter-two/)

_Kevin Ashworth sported a funky, thick mustache and often stole the show with his high-energy performance and crazy antics about life._ -- [Stu News Laguna](http://stunewslaguna.com/index.php/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7506:chapter-two-011513)

_Terrific cast. A rousing revival by a splendid company at the Laguna Playhouse._ -- [Daily Pilot](http://www.dailypilot.com/entertainment/tn-dpt-0118-titus-mother-hat-chapter-two-20130116,0,3189152.story)

_In order to lighten the serious tones, Simon creates flawed buddies for the protagonists, and the play couldn’t do better than Kevin Ashworth’s Leo and Leslie Stevens’ Faye. Ashworth’s playboy Leo looks like a 1970's version of a young Jack Nicholson with his polyester clothing and his thin mustache._ -- [LA Splash](http://www.lasplash.com/publish/Los_Angeles_Performances_116/chapter-two-theatre-review-a-theatrical-best-seller-at-laguna-beach.php)
