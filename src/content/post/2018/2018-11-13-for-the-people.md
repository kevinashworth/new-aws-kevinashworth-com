Had a fantastic shoot as a Guest Star on [**For the People**](https://abc.go.com/shows/for-the-people). I got to play a judge for the first time, and it was awesome. Though I mostly just sat there, it was a long shoot day with take after take of exploring, and doing[^1], and having fun, and even hamming it up a little (a lot).

It first aired on May 2, 2019. The clip here is an edited version that includes lots of coverage of other actors, to tell the story arc for Vondie Curtis-Hall&#039;s SDNY judge character in this episode.
