Had a fantastic shoot as a Guest Star on [**For the People**](https://abc.go.com/shows/for-the-people). I got to play a judge for the first time, and it was awesome. Though I mostly just sat there, it was a long shoot day with take after take of exploring, and doing[^1], and having fun, and even hamming it up a little (a lot).

It first aired on May 2, 2019. The clip here is an edited version that includes lots of coverage of other actors, to tell the story arc for Vondie Curtis-Hall&#039;s SDNY judge character in this episode.

Everybody on the set of **FTP** was a pleasure to work with. Thank you for the very fun times! Thank you exec, director and writer Tom Verica, Valerie Weiss and Chelsea Grate, series reg Vondie, and fellow cast mates Brea, Jill, Matt, Courtney, Devika, Sandy, Tracy, Brendan, Zach, and B-cam and C-cam Andy and Alicia, and wardrobe Ambre, and makeup Kati, and hair Staci, and PA Andrea, and tall AD Terry, and everybody else on that set! And thank you of course to casting director Jamie Castro.
