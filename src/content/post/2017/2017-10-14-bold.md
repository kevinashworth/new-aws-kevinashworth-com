This shoot was a great experience for me. Not that most shoots aren't great experiences. But the material of this scene was meaningful to me -- I get choked up about health and insurance issues so often these days -- and the audition process, and the subsequent shoot came at just a right time. Scott and Darren were great to work with, and I loved being there. I hope "Employee" comes back and gets a name. I'd dig that. Ed Scott, write me back in, buddy!
