Iâ€™m busy prepping <b>Walt Disney</b> for you, my friends. Quite a role, quite a show. Feeling wonderful about it. Opens March 26th, and closes May 1st, 2022!

Often, tickets are also available on [Goldstar](https://www.goldstar.com/events/los-angeles-ca/a-public-reading-of-an-unproduced-screenplay-about-the-death-of-walt-disney-tickets-1) or [TodayTix](https://www.todaytix.com/los-angeles/shows/21524-a-public-reading-of-an-unproduced-screenplay-about-the-death-of-walt-disney).

<b>Update April 6:</b> We are getting some nice attention around town, including the [L.A. Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-04-05/death-of-walt-disney-lucas-hnath-review). Charles McNulty says I'm <q>note-perfect</q>, which I think is neat-o. Truly unexpected. And regardless of what any reviewer says, I am enjoying it a lot and I feel great!
