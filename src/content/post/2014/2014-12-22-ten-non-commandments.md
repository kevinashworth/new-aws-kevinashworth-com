<p>
  1. Be open-minded and be willing to alter your beliefs with new evidence.<br />
  2. Strive to understand what is most likely to be true, not to believe what you wish to be true.<br />
  3. The scientific method is the most reliable way of understanding the natural world.<br />
  4. Every person has the right to control of their body.<br />
  5. God is not necessary to be a good person or to live a full and meaningful life.<br />
  6. Be mindful of the consequences of all your actions and recognize that you must take responsibility for them.<br />
  7. Treat others as you would want them to treat you, and can reasonably expect them to want to be treated. Think about
  their perspective.<br />
  8. We have the responsibility to consider others, including future generations.<br />
  9. There is no one right way to live.<br />
  10. Leave the world a better place than you found it.

  Who, not knowing their provenance, would disagree with any of these? (This is a serious question, not rhetorical.)
