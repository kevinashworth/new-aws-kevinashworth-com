Recent bookings this fall:

- Shot another episode of [_Scandal_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4167128/fullcredits). Oh the spoilers I could tell.
- Did an episode of [_Jane the Virgin_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4079620/fullcredits) as a cheap lawyer. Fun scene!
- Worked on [_Faking It_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4037850/fullcredits) as a pageant announcer. Purple bow-tie awesomeness.
- Filmed an episode of [_Marry Me_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4124016/) as a, let’s just say, well-meaning pediatrician.

That last one might actually be the most hilarious. [_Marry Me_](http://www.nbc.com/marry-me) is very funny so far in its first episodes, and that shoot was definitely the zaniest. We wrapped in the wee hours of the morning and it was cuh-razy! I’ll post more here and/or on Twitter for all of them as their air dates approach.
