Watching Fox News means choosing to inhibit your intellect. Why do people do that? Because the truth is too hard to bear, is my best answer so far.

Being smart is sometimes painful compared to being medium or being dumb. This has probably always been the case. Thinking people over the centuries have turned to drugs to numb their brains. Is the new addictive way to inhibit intellect significantly different?

LDS people will abstain from drugs because, um, drugs are bad. Frankly, little effort is put in by Mormons to use that restriction as an exemplar or jumping off point to consider any connection between the Word of Wisdom and the willful inhibiting of the intellect. Mormons just do what the rules are. Also, we are champions at sweeping things under the rug, which has long been our favorite form of inhibiting the intellect.

That said, a prior generation of Mormons made pins for the youth-focused area of the church called the Mutual Improvement Association[^1], and emblazoned those pins with “The Glory of God Is Intelligence” -- so there is hope. Maybe the intellectually inhibited will diminish in prominence again someday. Hopefully they will be outnumbered by those who seek Truth and that it makes them free, i.e., not inhibited.

Meanwhile, all of humanity needs to stay cautious against the growth of false news through lying humans and the increasingly many bots controlled by liars.

Do your part. Avoid bad info. Don’t watch F News.
