I attended a meeting wherein I got a good look at how notes that you or your representation submit on Actors Access / Breakdown Services are seen by the folks in casting.

Here are some examples of what casting sees, copied from actual notes. I should add that notes appear in a standard sans-serif font to the folks in casting, but I include them here using a fixed-width font to illustrate a point.

The first line is something I included to show that the cutoff is clearly 40 characters. On the last line, the submitter included an errant space after "Adv," and you should know that the penultimate note showed "years" as "y/ears", looking something like this:

```

```

To reiterate, what casting directors see, if they don't click through to read the whole note, is the first 40 characters, and after about the 32nd character, words may wrap in an ugly way.

Hope this helps you submit better notes!
