### Renée Zellweger in _Judy_

A full-body transformation! Look at her spine, neck, shoulders, voice, face, and a core character attitude. These are all different from Renee's default way of being. What a remarkable transformation.

### Brad Pitt in _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood_ & Laura Dern in _A Marriage Story_

I don't see full-body transformations here. These are performances that are strong throughout, and that hinge on the characters' core attitudes.

### The Cast of _Knives Out_

Rian Johnson on the actors: "Getting the caliber of actors we were able to get, you know, I think they were able to take the characters much bigger than they maybe even read on the page. And because **it takes a really good actor to give, like, a huge performance** like that and still have it not tip over into it feeling just like a joke, to have it still feel like it has its feet on the ground, or at least one foot on the ground at all times. And so, **I think the cast that we got allowed us to play it a little broader than it maybe even read on the page and still have the movie tick.**" (From the [_3rd & Fairfax_](https://www.wga.org/3rdandfairfax/) podcast episode 179, starting at the 34:44 mark. Emphasis mine.)

In other words, to be big and good requires being a better actor than to be medium and good.

<small>(P.S. Also watch Rian talk about the big, good performances in [this SAG-AFTRA Foundation Q&A](https://youtu.be/u67hupQgIaI?t=597).)</small>

### The Cast of _Parasite_

I thought they were a great ensemble. Voted for them for the SAG Awards. Juicy acting throughout.

### Go Get ’Em!

Be bold, fellow actors. Be big and juicy. Train well and be "huge" if you can!
