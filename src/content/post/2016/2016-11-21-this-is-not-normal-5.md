<p>
  A little unrhymed verse because the things that rhyme are so. very. disturbing. (I&#8217;ve written
  <a href="/tag/Verse">a few</a> that are more humorous, as well.)
</p>
<p>
  Herr Drumpf does not <i>see guile</i>,<br />
  As those who do find <i>fault might</i>.<br />
  Having never seen such <i>swine furor</i>,<br />
  I wonder how can he <i>not see</i>?
