  “I respect the view of any actors or stage managers who are fully informed of their rights and choices and wish
  to [donate] their talent to the stage &hellip; but it does not follow that the freedom to volunteer should infringe on
  the rights of the most vulnerable among us, who are legally entitled to be paid for their work. &hellip; For those at
  the margins of our community, a little help can make a big difference in their quality of life. It may enable them to
  continue in the field that we all cherish so deeply. It’s that crucial oil change you neglected so you can keep
  driving to rehearsals. It’s taking a day off from a stressful day-job. It’s their money, they earned it,
  and if they ask for it, it’s the law.”
