  <strong>The <del>Christmas</del> <ins>Nightmare</ins> Song</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Your nuts roasting on an open fire;<br />
  Mike Pence clipping off your toe;<br />
  Your bride Carol being tongued by Paul Ryan:<br />
  Not jokes messed up like news that’s faux,<br />
  Everybody knows that Trumpey with our missile codes<br />
  Helps to make these nightmares bright.<br />
  Whiny snots with red ties worn too low<br />
  Make it hard to sleep at night.
</p>
<p>
  They care that Santa isn’t gay.<br />
  They focus all their justices on Roe v Wade.<br />
  But every decent child and FBI<br />
  Wanna see if Putin really knew how to spy.<br />
  And so I’m offering this simple phrase<br />
  To swing states that should now be blue.<br />
  Although it’s been tweeted many times, many ways,<br />
  On this Christmas, screw you.
</p>
<p>
  They want to kill the working class.<br />
  These loaded good ol’ boys will get us in the ass.<br />
  And every right-wing pile is gonna try<br />
  To give the sincere reason to cry.<br />
  And so I’m offering this sinful phrase<br />
  To ids who’ve-voted-straight-Republican since ’Ninety-Two.<br />
  Although it’s been Facebooked many times, many ways,<br />
  On this Christmas, (middle finger) you.
</p>
