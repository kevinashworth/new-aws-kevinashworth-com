<p>
  Let dreamers dream<br />
  &nbsp; what worlds they please<br />
  Those Edens can’t be found<br />
  The sweetest flowers<br />
  &nbsp; the fairest trees<br />
  Are grown in solid ground
</p>
<p>
  We’re neither pure<br />
  &nbsp; nor wise nor good<br />
  We’ll do the best we know<br />
  We’ll build our house<br />
  &nbsp; and chop our wood<br />
  And make our garden grow
</p>

  I've found this <em>Candide</em> lyric over the years to be very moving. Just watched
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlVD-jrq_Yk">this version</a> on YouTube. It gave me goosebumps. So lovely.
