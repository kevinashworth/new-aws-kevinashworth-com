  facts re AEA and 99 and what Council passed, compared to the initially proposed 3 prongs:
</p>
<p>The language of the LOS ANGELES SELF-PRODUCED PROJECT CODE is identical to what was in the initial proposal.</p>
<p>The language of the LOS ANGELES MEMBERSHIP COMPANY RULE changed significantly.</p>
<p>
  The language of the LOS ANGELES 99-SEAT THEATRE AGREEMENT is very close to the version that was in the initial
  proposal. The one change in the version that Council passed today is that it specifies 2-hour blocks instead of 3-hour
  blocks.
