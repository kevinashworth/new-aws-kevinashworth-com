The year 2015 has gotten off to a good start with multiple shoots in January. I have worked on [_Marvel’s Agent Carter_](http://abc.go.com/shows/marvels-agent-carter) and more than one episode of [_Scandal_](http://abc.go.com/shows/scandal). Oh the spoilers I could tell you! But I won’t tell. I was truly moved reading the scripts, and these lovely stories will have to unfold before your very eyes soon enough on [ABC](http://abc.go.com/). And, of course, I’ll tweet about them … soon enough.
