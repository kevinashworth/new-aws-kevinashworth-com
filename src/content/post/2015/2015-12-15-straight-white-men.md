A short, exciting update: I’ve been understudying _Straight White Men_ at the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, and I’ve just learned that I’m going on for tonight’s performance (Tuesday, Dec 15 at 8pm).

The play and its author, Young Jean Lee, have generated a lot of talk, including [at](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-new-american-playwrights-20151122-column.html) [least](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-straight-white-men-review-20151124-column.html) [three](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-young-jean-lee-20151122-story.html) recent articles in the _LA Times_. Information about this production, including tickets and driving directions, can be found on the [Center Theatre Group’s site](https://www.centertheatregroup.org/tickets/kirk-douglas-theatre/2015-16/straight-white-men/).

That’s it! Short message because I have a lot of other things to do right now (!), but I will be tweeting updates with the hashtag [#swmigo](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23swmigo), i.e., **Straight White Men — I’m going on**!

(<span style="font-variant: all-small-caps;">Wednesday update</span>: It was a blast last night, but I don’t expect to go on again. Will post more updates if that changes!)
